          <h2>Hello! I'm <span>Roxan,</span></h2> <br>
          <p>As a child, I drew on everything. I drew on books, dolls, walls, floors, the cabinet doors, and the dogs... But thankfully, when I first got a drawing tablet at age 12, I completely fell in love with digital art form and have stuck with it ever since then.</p> <br>
<p>Prior to college, I was already very proficient in using <strong>Adobe Photoshop, Painter</strong> and <strong>Paint Tool SAI</strong>. This was especially helpful in getting into <span class="pink">Seneca College's Animation Program</span>, and from where I learned how to animate on <strong>paper</strong>, on <strong>Adobe Flash</strong>, and on <strong>Toonboom</strong>. </p><br>
<p>To explore new forms of digital media, I then chose Game Art and Design as a specialization which focused more on modeling, texturing, rigging and animating using <strong>3DS Max</strong>, <strong>Zbrush</strong>, <strong>xNormal</strong>, <strong>nDO</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. Outside of school, I also taught myself how to model and animate using <strong>Autodesk Maya</strong>. I have an innate ability to not just quickly learn computer programs, but how to successfully combine my artistic skills with my computer skills. </p><br>
The next step in my journey is to obtain a position at an exciting studio that will enable me to continue learning and growing as an artist and as an animator. I'm very eager to be a part of this industry that, similar to myself, keeps redefining itself and pushing the envelope.<br>
